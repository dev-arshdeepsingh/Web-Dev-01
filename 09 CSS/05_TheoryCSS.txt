Pseudo Element:   (::) - This symbol creates a pseudo element,Eg: ::after is the last child of selected element & used to add styles in that tag.So this :: adds a new elemnt of inline nature. See .ribbon example on this link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after

p::after{
    content: "Hello";
    color: yellow;
    background-color: Black;
}
(the above eg won't effect p tag, It will only create a text hello with applied css after the end of p tag)
