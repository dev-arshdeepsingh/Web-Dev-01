CSS:- Cascading Style sheets
eg: Moving button on center, right, left of screen etc. & also changing its color etc
But nowadays we dont have to write it from scratch, there exists a pre wriiten code eg: for navigation bar etc & we just have to customise it. These are called CSS libraries or Framework eg:- Bootstrap, Materialize CSS, Tailwind CSS(Recommendded for beginner), Shadcn, Aceternity, magicUI, daisyUI, flowbite(coorporate love it), MUI, antdesign(coorporate love it) etc.

Dont scare from CSS, It's all on google.

We will learn how to edit each component on website, but at the end of the day we are gonna use Frameworks

Advice:
01. Firstly focus on font, as it consumes most space on webpage. It genuinly changes the feel.
02. Second, is which images are used and how they are placed on webpage.
03. Third and at last focus on components ie how button, list, card looks like.

* Cascading means the flow of style that how styling was applied on upper element & how it cascades to lower elements.

We can use CSS in 3 ways:
01. Inline: We add styles to individual html tags, Using a global attribute called (Styles = ""). Then we use CSS properties inside this attribute eg: 
 <h1 style="color:orangered;">   HELLO WORLD   </h1>

02. Using Head Tag: In this also we don't have to create a separate CSS file, as we can add styles inside head tag using style tag. And then name html tag to be styled with curly braces & us CSS propertiesinside it.
Eg: <head>
            <style>
                h2{
                color: brown;
                 }
            </style>
    </head>

03. Using separate CSS File: It is better way as it is easy to manage and manipulate, However it too has its own advantages and disadvantages.
here we create new file in same folder with name Name.css (eg: style.css), then we have to link it in html inside head tag using link tag ie 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="sty.css(FILE NAME)">


NOW PRIORITY ORDER IN CASE WE USE ALL THESE TYPES ON 1 HTML FILE THEN PRIORITY ORDER WILL BE:-
