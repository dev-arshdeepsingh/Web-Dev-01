Selectors : used to select the elements on webpage

CSS is generally created using tailwind in professional world

Eg of selectors is classes, DOM is used to load a webpage in html in browser successfully

Selectors are majorly used in DOM


Border Box:- It is a box sizing which will be discussed later

Margin is distance b\w upper element and lower element, when we apply margin distance between tags gets increased or decreased but the size of content inside the element remains same.

padding is space inside an element if we apply padding size of content inside that element gets small 

we use hash codes or hex code to choose colors however there are other ways also like rgb etc 
We don't write color names directly because red for 1 browser maybe different for other browser.

[//Brackets]
{//Braces}

Pseudo class is used to add addtional properties like colors on hover

But only id and classes are imp, for rest we use tailwind.
