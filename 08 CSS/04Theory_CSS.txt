Box Model is a way to go to Tailwind, CSS. It should be default for every browser but for now we have to define it explicitely

Box-Sizing: Border-Box will make the box of constant size i.e in case we apply padding it will be applied in such a way that it does'nt changes defined box size but it will manipulate the content size


DEFAULT IS CONTENT-BOX

"Differnece between content-box & border=box is that cause when u set height =300px then in contebt-box it is not 300px cause we have to add padding & border but in Border-Box it is guaranteed 300px even after we add padding and border to it & that's why everyone loves it."


 border-box = size of content + padding + border

In the above scenario,


width = width of content


border-box width = width of content + left padding + right padding + left border + right border

"when using box-sizing : content-box; the content size remain same while border-box size grows as padding and border grow. but when using box-sizing: border-box; , the size of border-box remains same while size of content decreases as padding and border grow."

Inline vs Block Elements
"use "display: inline/block" to convert their inline/block behaviour"

Inline element takes as much space as it is reqd. by the content in that element.

Block element element consumes whole space from left to right of the screen

The Box Model consist of Content + padding + border + Margin
