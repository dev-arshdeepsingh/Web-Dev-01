Browser injects its initial margin and and padding by default so we have to set it to 0px

Flex box is a display property which make element moving very easy and fast
1st property in it is viewport height: height = 100vh & also set justify-content & align-items to center

Note: Flex property works on parent alement ie if we want to add flex property to form we will add flex to body
eg:  form {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;} //It will change column default direction



imp. Properties:
01. Border-Radius
02. Margin means outer space
03. while padding means inner breathable space
